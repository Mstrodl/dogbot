# `dogbot`

Dogbot is my personal Discord bot that I use on my servers. It has no real
purpose, it just has handy commands that I like to use! Some serve
administrative or utility purposes, and some are just for fun!

Dogbot is currently undergoing steady development. I try to add new features
everyday, so please bear with me and submit feedback if something goes wrong!

## Submitting feedback

Run `dog, feedback submit <feedback text here...>` to submit feedback to the
bot. This feedback goes directly to me, so **please, please, please** do not
abuse this in any way. Doing so will get you blocked from submitting important
feedback!

## Uptime and disclaimer

I try to keep Dogbot running 24/7. However, please don't complain when the bot
goes down or disappears entirely! I am a busy person, and I apologize ahead of
time if the bot causes trouble due to it being down or misbehaving.

I am not responsible for any damages caused by Dogbot. Don't worry though,
Dogbot never purposely causes any damages to your server unless I have made a
mistake somewhere. If it does, please report it to me as feedback (see above).

## Contributing

I love contributions! Please send me them by opening a pull request or by
opening an issue if you notice something.

## Running your own

I heavily prefer that you [invite Dogbot to your server](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?permissions=0&scope=bot&client_id=295770389584412683) instead of running your instance of Dogbot.

However, if you really want to...

### Requirements

- Python 3.6 (not 3.5 or below)
- Required Python modules (check `requirements.txt`, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- MongoDB

### Configuration

Create a `dog_config.py` file in the root of the repository.

```py
token = '<your token...>'
prefix = ['dog, ', 'd?', 'd!']
mongo_url = 'localhost'
owner_id = <your id...>
github = '<your github username>/<repository name>'
client_id = <bot's client id...>
```

Specify your token and prefixes.

Note that some variables in the bot are hardcoded in and are not configurable.
Please look for these occurrences in the code and replace them if applicable.

I try to keep the code as readable as possible!

### Optional packages

 - `uvloop`: Install this for possibly faster `asyncio`! Windows is not
   supported.

### Running

When you're done configuring, start `dog.py`.
