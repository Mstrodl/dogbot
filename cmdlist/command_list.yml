      You can use this command to temporarily mute someone. The time parameter
      of the command allows you to specify the amount of time that the person
      will spend muted, and it uses [human time](https://github.com/sliceofcode/dogbot/wiki/Human-time).
      If unmute_announce is set, then when the person is eventually unmuted,
      their unmute will be announced in the channel that the moderator has run
      d?mute in. For more information, see [Configuration](https://github.com/sliceofcode/dogbot/wiki/Configuration).

  mute_setup:

    bot_needs: ['Manage Messages']
    description: >
      Sets up the "Muted" role if it doesn't exist, and sets up channel
      overrides for all channels. By default, the channel overrides deny the
      `Send Messages` permission for all channels.


      If you wish to deny the `Read Messages` permission if someone is muted,
      ensure that `mutesetup_disallow_read` is set before running `d?mute_setup`.
      If it is set, then you will be prompted for a list of channels that will
      not have `Read Messages` denied, but still have `Send Messages` denied.
      This is because some useful channels such as `#announcements` still
      deserve to be read, for example.


      For even more information on this topic, run `d?help mute_setup`. The mute
      setup process is detailed. **Be sure to read everything.**
